            <h2>About me:</h2>
            <p>As an experienced AWS DevOps Engineer at V Corporation, I specialize in managing and optimizing cloud-based infrastructure for multiple high-traffic websites using the LEMP stack (Linux, Nginx, MySQL, PHP Laravel). My expertise extends across a broad spectrum of AWS services, including EC2, IAM, VPC, Lambda, CloudFront, ACM, and Route 53, where I ensure high availability, security, and cost-efficiency. I excel in automation using Bash scripting and Python, leveraging tools like Ansible for configuration management and GitLab for CI/CD pipelines. My role involves implementing AWS best practices, developing observability solutions with AWS CloudWatch, and integrating real-time notification systems with Telegram. With a solid foundation in network engineering and certifications like AWS Cloud Practitioner and CCNA, I am committed to driving innovation and fostering business growth through scalable and resilient cloud solutions. Currently, I am preparing for the AWS Solutions Architect Associate exam to further enhance my expertise.</p>
